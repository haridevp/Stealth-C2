# 🥷 Stealth-C2: Red Team Operations Framework

> **⚠️ DISCLAIMER:** This software is for **Educational Purposes and Authorized Security Testing ONLY.** The author takes no responsibility for misuse. Do not install this on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

## 📡 Overview

**Stealth-C2** is a lightweight, cross-platform Command & Control (C2) agent that leverages the Discord API for stealthy communication. By using a legitimate high-reputation service as a proxy, the agent bypasses traditional firewall restrictions and keeps traffic blended with normal user activity.

Unlike basic reverse shells, Stealth-C2 employs **Steganographic Protocols** (Emoji-based commands), **AES-256 Encryption** for data exfiltration, **V1.0 Key Management** (dynamic key generation & rotation), and **Automated Failover Logic** to maintain situational awareness even in hardened environments (e.g., Wayland secure boot).

## ⚡ Key Features

### 🔐 Operational Security (OpSec)

- **Steganographic Command Protocol:** All C2 traffic is disguised as innocuous chat messages using an Emoji-to-Function mapping (e.g., `📸` triggers surveillance).
    
- **Anti-Analysis Module:** Automatically detects forensic tools (Wireshark, ProcMon) and sandbox environments (Cuckoo). Engages a "Kill Switch" if a threat is detected.
    
- **Traffic Blending:** Uses HTTPS (Port 443) via `discord.com`, making the traffic indistinguishable from normal browsing.
    

### 👁️ Resilient Surveillance

- **Smart-Capture Logic:** The agent intelligently detects the OS environment.
    
    1. Attempts **Native API Screenshot** (MSS/GDI).
        
    2. If blocked (e.g., Linux Wayland Security), it fails over to **Webcam Capture** (OpenCV/fswebcam).
        
    3. This ensures "eyes on target" even when screen recording is privileged.
        

### 📂 Secure Exfiltration

- **Military-Grade Encryption:** All exfiltrated files are encrypted client-side using **AES-256-GCM** before upload.
    
- **DLP Evasion:** Prevents Network DLP (Data Loss Prevention) systems from inspecting the content of stolen files.
    

### 🔑 Key Management (V1.0)

- **Dynamic Key Generation:** On first run, a cryptographically secure random 256-bit AES key is auto-generated — no hardcoded secrets in the source code.

- **Secure Local Storage:** The key is persisted to `~/.stealth_c2/key.bin` with `chmod 600` permissions (outside the repository, never committed).

- **Remote Key Rotation:** Send `🔑` in the Discord channel to instantly rotate the encryption key. The old key is automatically backed up so previously-exfiltrated files can still be decrypted.

- **Backup Recovery:** Use `python decrypt_tool.py --key-file ~/.stealth_c2/key_<timestamp>.bin.bak` to decrypt files encrypted before a rotation.


### 🔄 Persistence & Control

- **Auto-Start:** Installs persistence mechanisms specific to the OS:
    
    - **Linux:** User-level Systemd Service (No Sudo required).
        
    - **Windows:** Startup Folder injection.
        
- **RCE (Remote Command Execution):** Execute arbitrary shell commands remotely.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
    
- A Discord Account & Bot Token
    

### 1. Clone the Repository

Bash

```
git clone https://github.com/haridevp/Stealth-C2.git
cd Stealth-C2
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Bash

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

Ini, TOML

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
```

### 4. Build (Optional)

To compile the agent into a standalone executable (EXE/ELF):

Bash

```
pyinstaller --onefile --name agent --hidden-import mss --hidden-import cv2 src/main.py
```

## 🎮 Usage Guide (The Rosetta Stone)

Once the agent is running, control it via your Discord Server channel using these triggers:

|**Command**|**Emoji**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|**System Info**|`🐚`|Displays OS, Hostname, and Node architecture.|
|**Surveillance**|`📸`|Smart Capture: Tries Screen first, falls back to Webcam.|
|**Ping**|`👋`|Checks if the agent is alive and responsive.|
|**Exfiltration**|`📂`|`📂 /path/to/file` - Uploads an AES-Encrypted copy of the file.|
|**Execute**|`⚡`|`⚡ whoami` - Runs a terminal command and returns output.|
|**Persistence**|`🔄`|Installs the agent to Systemd (Linux) or Startup (Windows).|
|**Key Rotation**|`🔑`|Generates a new AES-256 key, backs up the old one, hot-reloads.|
|**Kill Switch**|`🛑`|Remotely terminates the agent process immediately.|

## 🔓 Decrypting Data

Files exfiltrated by the agent are encrypted with **AES-256-GCM**. To read them, use the provided tool:

1. Download the `.enc` file from Discord.

2. Run the decryptor (uses the active key automatically):

    ```bash
    python decrypt_tool.py
    ```

3. Drag and drop the file into the terminal when prompted.

**Decrypting files from before a key rotation** (use a backup key):

```bash
python decrypt_tool.py --key-file ~/.stealth_c2/key_<timestamp>.bin.bak /path/to/file.enc
```

> 💡 **Key backups** are stored in `~/.stealth_c2/` and named `key_<ISO-timestamp>.bin.bak`.
